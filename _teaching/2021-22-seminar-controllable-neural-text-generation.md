A seminar (in English)
* Winter semester 2021/22
* Suitable for BSc Computational Linguistics and MSc Language Science and Technology
* The classes will take place virtually on MS Teams. 


This seminar will cover neural language generation and ways to make it (more) controllable. More specifically, we will look into how NLG systems can adapt their output given the intended application or the end-user's needs. We will read papers on text simplification, dialog generation, machine translation and text summarization. This course follows the usual seminar structure: for 4 CP, a student should prepare a talk about a selected paper. Additionally, 3 CP can be earned by writing a final term paper or a small coding project.

Interested students should send me an email by **20 October** including the following:
1. Study program and semester
2. Research interests
3. Why do you want to participate in this course?
4. Your name on MS Teams (so that you can be added to the team)
